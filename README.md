# LAYG

Authored by *Rufus Mbugua* [<mbuguarufus@gmail.com>]



## What is Laravel-Angular-YEOMAN-Generator?
LAYG is just that. All the fixins boiled into a functional Laravel-Angular App.

LAYG is built on [Laravel](laravel.com) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) .

## Getting Started
I'll put up the Yeoman Docs here in a bit.

For now, Read the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and run
`php artisan serve --host 0.0.0.0` in the Working Directory.

## Architecture
### Front-End
The systemâ€™s front-end is written in AngularJS version 1.4.* coupled with package managers and Javascript Task Runners namely:
+ Bower
+ Grunt

### BackEnd
This is written in PHP, riding on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) version 5.*.

### Database
For this project we used MySQL 5.*.
You could find additional documentation [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/).

We also used [Redis](http://redis.io/) for caching requested data.

### Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery

We are now using **Gitlab CI** for testing as well as **Buddy GO** for CI and CD.

## INSTALLATION
For installation instructions, straight from GIT, read [this](INSTALL.md).

## CONTRIBUTING
For contributing instructions, read [this](CONTRIBUTING.md).
